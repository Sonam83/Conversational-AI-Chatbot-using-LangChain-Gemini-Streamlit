# Conversational-AI-Chatbot-using-LangChain-Gemini-Streamlit

# Project Overview :

This project is an interactive Conversational AI chatbot built using Streamlit, LangChain, and Google Gemini.
It demonstrates real-time LLM interaction, session-based memory management, and prompt engineering to create a ChatGPT-like conversational experience.

# Objective :

To design a lightweight, scalable conversational AI application that supports:
Real-time LLM responses
Multi-turn context awareness
Controlled LLM behavior using system prompts

# Technologies Used :

Frontend & UI: Streamlit

LLM Orchestration: LangChain

Large Language Model: Google Gemini (ChatGoogleGenerativeAI)

Backend Language: Python

Environment Management: python-dotenv

# Application Workflow :

User enters a query through a chat-style Streamlit interface.

Input is stored in session-based memory for context retention.

LangChain forwards the conversation history to Google Gemini.

Gemini generates a real-time response based on system and user prompts.

The response is rendered instantly while preserving chat history.

# Learning Outcomes :

Hands-on experience with LangChain and LLM orchestration

Practical implementation of prompt engineering

Managing LLM conversation memory

Building production-style Streamlit AI applications
